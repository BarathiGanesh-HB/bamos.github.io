Artificial Intelligence has been a major breakthrough in many domains. Now, it has started automating health care
domain through Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision applications. As a part of it, researchers are now
focusing more on mining health related information from the text shared through social media and clinical trials. This
paper explains about our system for health care text classification tasks conducted by Health Language Processing
(HLP) Lab. We experimented with representing the target classes available in task 1 and task 2 as vectors. The
classification has been performed using Support Vector Machine. To compute the representation for target classes,
we used traditional methods available in Vector Space Models and Vector Space Models of Semantics. In this shared
task, the task 1 is about distinguishing the tweets mentioning ”adverse drug reaction” from the ones which do not.
The task 2 is about distinguishing the tweets that includes personal medication intake, possible medication intake and
non-intake. The preliminary results are satisfying in-order to continue the research in developing a representation
method for target classes.
